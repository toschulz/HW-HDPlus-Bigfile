B5 Weapons Mod for Homeworld Release V2.0  - 06/9/2000
--------------------------------------------------------------

What this does:
This file replaces the textures of the weapons in homeworld to fit into the b5 universe, it does this by altering the .ebg files. There are a set of replacement .shp files in th r1+r2 dirs to test with.

This modification builds on the ion cannon work done by Crook. I have expanded and updated his work to include better textures, new hit and fireing effects and of course new beam and cannon textures.

As of release 2 I have updated some of the textures and added firing and hit effects for all weapons. 

To Install:
1) make sure you read about what this file does before you install.

2) make sure that you have a clean/fresh install of mod version 2.3 + Omega for older mod (if you have not got this just delete the carrier.mex and carrier.shp from the r1 dir)

3) expand this zip into the homeworld dir. so that r1, r2, etg are dirs in the homeworld root dir. This Will replace the .shp files unless you extract manually

4) start homeworld normally.

Third party ships may corrupt textures if installed due to not having their textures entered into the texture.ll database.
