Unzip the zip file called 'ETG_Final_Beta_Public.zip' to you homeworld directory
(Default: C:/Sierra/Homeworld). You should get a folder called 'ETG'. If you just get a bunch of files, re-download the file - it's corrupted. 
That's it! Now go and blast some crazy Taiidan, but stay away from their HC's...for now O_o


Heh.. I'll make a better readme later.. maybe.. :-D

Ok.. It's later now.. But the readmes still going to be cheesy.. :-p

This mod changes all the adaquate but dated effects in homeworld to the stupendously glorious ones I mutated from the Cnl's weapons pack.. I'd list all the changes made but a) I'm far too lazy.. b) An ingame view of them in action would be much more effective than my stumbling prose could ever express.. c) I've already detailed it out here..

If your going to play in skirmish or singleplayer then you will need to install the seperate heavy cruiser crash fix or losing/destroying a heavy cruiser will crash the game.. Why? I have absofuckingloutly no idea.. I've combed the files for errors.. I've followed both the Cnl's and SvK's suggestions.. Nothing works.. NOTHING.. :-( Well except maybe making a new textures.II file for the new effect textures.. Thats the only option I haven't tried.. Why? see a).. I've included the PSD's for a new textures.II incase some kind soul decides to be generous.. ;-) Suffice it to say that the mod works flawlessly in skirmish and single with the crash fix patch install.. WON is a different matter altogether.. Works crash free for me.. Crashes and Burns for others.. Dunno.. hopefully others with greater knowledge than me can figure it out.. 

One last item.. This mod is based on Cnl Peppers works and as he let all use it I shall grant the same license to all other modders.. just credit me and the Cnl and include this readme along with the Cnl's original readme in anything you distribute.. See Cnl Pepper's B5 Weapons Pack Readme.txt for more info..

Enjoy..
